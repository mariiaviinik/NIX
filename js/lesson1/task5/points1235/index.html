        <h1>Who Is a Front-End Developer?</h1>
        <p>
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development<br>
            is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website<br>
            or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.<br>
            The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools<br>
            and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly<br>
            and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the<br>
            site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.<br>
            This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices<br>
            with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration<br>
            these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly<br>
            in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different<br>
            devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

        <h1>What is the workplace of a Front-End Developer like?</h1>
        <p>
            Decent salaries, high demand, job security, and plenty of options for mobility are just some of the perks<br>
            that come with a career in front-end web development. Employers look for problem solvers, not just<br>
            people who can code, but people who can sit down with visual and user experience designers to<br>
            solve major challenges.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Front-end development is a pretty flexible field in terms of where and when it can get done. The<br>
            amount of freelance work available tends to be just as plentiful as full-time openings.
