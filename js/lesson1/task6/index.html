        <h1>Ecology</h1>
        <p>
            Ecology is the study of the environment, and helps us understand how
            organisms live with each other in unique physical environments.

            Ecology is the study of organisms and how they interact with the environment 
            around them. An ecologist studies the relationship between living things and 
            their habitats. In order to learn about the natural world, ecologists must study
            multiple aspects of life ranging from the moss that grows on rocks to the wolf 
            population in Yellowstone National Park. In order to research the environment, 
            scientists ask questions, such as: How do organisms interact with the living and
            nonliving factors around them? What do organisms need to survive and thrive 
            in their current environments? To find the answers to these questions, ecologists
            must study and observe all forms of life and their ecosystems throughout our world.

        <p>     
            A keystone species helps define an entire ecosystem. Without its keystone species,<br>
            the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether...
