    <h1>Role of Keystone Species in an Ecosystem</h1>
    <p>
        A keystone species helps define an entire ecosystem. Without its keystone species, 
        the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether.

    <h4>Ochre Sea Star</h4>
    <p>
        A keystone species is an organism that helps define an entire ecosystem. 
        By keeping populations of mussels and barnacles in check, this sea star helps 
        ensure healthy populations of seaweeds and the communities that feed on themâ€”sea 
        urchins, sea snails, limpets, and bivalves. Pisaster ochraceus sea stars like
        this one were the first animals to be identified as keystone species.

    <p>
        A keystone species is an organism that helps define an entire ecosystem.If the 
        keystone species were to disappear from the ecosystem, no other species would be
        able to fill its environmental role. The ecosystem would be forced to radically 
        change, allowing new and possibly invasive species to take over the habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any organism, from plants to fungi, may be a keystone species. They are not always 
        the largest or most abundant species in an ecosystem. However, almost all examples 
        of keystone species are animals that have a huge influence on food webs. The way 
        these animals influence food webs varies from habitat to habitat.
