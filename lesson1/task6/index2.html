    <h4>Leaf-Cutter Ants</h4>
    <p>
        By harvesting leaves to cultivate fungus in underground gardens,
        leaf-cutter ants play an important role in structuring tropical
        plant communities. A special caste of smaller ants ride on the surface 
        of cut leaves to defend workers from parasitic insects. This photograph
        was taken on a tropical ecology fieldtrip in Southeastern Peru.

        Every organism depends on living and non-living things to survive. 
        Ecology is the branch of science that examines the relationships organisms
        have to each other and to their environment. Scientists who study those 
        relationships are called ecologists.
        There are many different ways to study ecology. Some types are landscape
        ecology, population ecology, and behavioral ecology.

        Landscape ecology deals with spatial distribution, patterns, and behaviors 
        across large geographical areas. Landscape ecologists might study the impact
        of development on a particular species of native grass in a specific area. 
        One type of grass may be resistant to chemicals, for example, indicating the
        area would be ideal for agricultural development.
        Population ecology studies the rise and fall in the number of a species. 
        A population ecologist may compare the population of a species near a new 
        food source to a population that lacks access to that food source. The new
        food source may increase the numbers of the species, or, if the food source 
        is contaminated, reduce it.
